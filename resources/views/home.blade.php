                I am a full-stack developer with a focus on the backend.
                My native tongue is <strong>PHP</strong> with <strong>MySQL</strong> for data storage.
                I have experience with various technologies and frameworks, including
                <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>.

            </p>
            <p class="text-base mb-4">
                I am focused on clean code and being mindful of the future so that
                my code works great and as time goes on keeps its value. In 
                other words, I am great to work with as I strongly believe that teamwork and 
                mutual respect are the keys to the success of any great project.

                    I consider challenges to be the greatest teacher and forward-moving force. JFK 
                    quote I live by - "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other 
                    things not because they are easy, but because they are hard."

                    Being the eldest of 10 children this skill is a matter of survival. What I have learned 
                    when sharing a living space with so many people, mutual respect is what 
                    powers teamwork to make the dream work.
